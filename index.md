## THE CAMPUSES
There are three campuses of PESU:
* The Hanumantha Nagar Campus (the HN campus)
* The Ring Road Campus (the RR campus)
* The Electronics City Campus (the EC campus)

Out of these, the HN campus is the oldest and the first ever campus of PES, the RR campus is the most developed and biggest campus, and EC campus is a rather spacious and peaceful one, with a planned medical college and hospital.

## THE BIG SHOTS
These are the people on the top of the PESU administration:
* Prof. M R Doreswamy - Chancellor
* Prof. Jawahar Doreswamy - Pro-Chancellor
* Dr. Suryaprasad J - Vice Chancellor

## GENERAL STUFF
This is the most important section of this guide, so read each and every bit.


### Stuff to know
* ID Card is a must, no matter what else you bring. This is to ensure security in the campus. Also, should you forget to bring your ID Card, you can always show your profile in the PESU App to gain entry to the campus. But you may be stopped and questioned in various places across campus.
* A minimum of 80 - 85% of attendance is necessary in every subject to be eligible to write the end sems. Did I say every subject? Yes, attendance is taken subject-wise in universities, not day-wise. Please do remember that.
* You can roam around the campus. There is no restriction on that freedom. As long as you don't break any rules, that is.
* Please do NOT use smartphones during classes. According to new rules, if you're caught, the SIM card and the memory card will be returned and the phone will not be returned till the end of the semester.

### Classes
Here's the timetable for majority of the days:
* For all UG Programs in Engineering, Architecture,Design and Performing Arts

|      1      |      2      |       3      |     Break     |       4       |       5       |       6       |  Lunch Break  |       7       |       8       |       9       |

In the first hour, there is a pardon of upto 10 minutes, which means you will be allowed into the class until 8:10, after which you might be allowed into the class but without attendance. No pardon for classes after breaks.

### Stuff you should have
* **A book for notes.** A 5-subject spiral bound book is usually given by the university, so that's more than enough.
* **Blue Book:** A thin, 16-page book (with an obvious blue paper bind) used to write assessments and other lab exams. Costs around ₹10 - ₹12, so buy atleast 2 for each subject.
* **A calculator:** Only a basic-level scientific calculator is allowed. Programmable calculators are not allowed. The most recommended calculator is [Casio fx-991EX](https://www.casio.com/in/scientific-calculators/product.FX-991EX/).

***

### The Examination System
There are three types of examinations/tests held in PES:

#### Class Assignments / Lab assignments
Normal assignments of around 20 marks, conducted in the class and written in blue books. 1 assignment is conducted for every unit, and the aggregate marks are considered for the final score.

!!!info 
There are no lab exams for Physics or Chemistry. Only for C and Python. In Physics, however, there may be a 30-mark lab MCQ.
!!!

#### ISA (Internal Semester Assessment)
One of the most important assessments. Conducted in the assessment centre, it is a Computer-Based Test (CBT). 
* There are 2 ISAs each having 2 units, and are for 20 marks, for 30 minutes.
* The timetable will be sent a week before, and the seating allotment is shown in the app on the day of the respective exam.
* Majority of the questions are MCQs and some of them are descriptive, for which the answers should be typed in the PC.
* A rough sheet will be given for calculations.
* You can (usually) leave the exam centre as soon as you finish the exam.

#### ESA (End Semester Assessment)
* The final test of your bravery. It is a 100-mark examination for every subject.
* Written in the assessment centres, and seating allotment is given. Spans for 3 hours.
* Completely descriptive. You will be given an answer booklet for the exam. 
* The questions are displayed on the PC, and you can either write the answers or type the answers.
* You can use a combination of both, for example type out an answer and draw a diagram.
* You can't leave the exam hall in the first 45 minutes, and the last 10 minutes of the exam.

### The PRN and SRN
PRN and SRN are two unique IDs that are provided to you.
* The PRN format is `PESxyyyyzzzzz`, where `x` is your campus code (1 is RR, 2 is EC), `yyyy` is the year of admission, and `zzzzz` is a unique number. Examples: PES1202212345.
* The SRN format is `PESxzzyyccnnn`, where `x` is campus code, `zz` specifies your general qualification (UG for undergraduate), `yy` for year of admission, `cc` is course code (CS, EC, EE, AM, ME etc) and `nn` is a unique number. Example: PES2UG22EC123. \[ sorry if I doxxed someone :') \]

***

### The Course Codes
Course codes are some really planned codes that give you a lot of information about the code. The pattern is really complex, and that's the reason I'll explain with examples:

* `UE22PH151A` (Engineering Physics)
	* `U` - Undergraduate
	* `E` - Engineering department course
	* `22` - Year that your batch starts from
	* `PH` - Subject code
	* `1` - year of study; can be 1, 2 and so on
	* `5` - Credits for the course
	* `1` - Number of courses of the same subject in the semester with the same number of credits
	* `A` - Letter indicating semester relative to that year; A is the first semester of that year, B is the second, and so on.
<br><br>

* `UL22CE111B` (Constitution Of India , Cyber Law and Professional Ethics)
	* `U` - Undergraduate
	* `L` - Law department course
	* `22` - Batch started in 2022
	* `CE` - Subject code
	* `1` - 1st year subject
	* `1` - 1 credit for the course
	* `1` - 1st CE subject in the same semester with 1 credits
	* `B` - 2nd semester of that year
<br><br>

* `UE22CS243A` (Automata Formal Languages and Logic)
	* `U` - Undergraduate
	* `E` - Engineering department course
	* `22` - Batch started in 2022
	* `CS` - CSE subject
	* `2` - 2nd year subject
	* `4` - 4 credits for the course
	* `3` - 2nd CSE subject in the same semester with 4 credits
	* `A` - 1st semester of that year

## THE FIRST YEAR
As long as you're in the first year, you are a part of the Science and Humanities (S&H) department. All students have to study a set of common subjects, irrespective of branch, for two semesters. 

***

### The Course Content
Students are divided into Physics and Chemistry cycles, usually based on alphabetical order of their names. But there are some common subjects in each semester irrespective of the cycle. If you get the Physics cycle in Sem 1, you'll get Chemistry cycle in Sem 2 and vice versa.

#### Common subjects
**FIRST SEMESTER**
* Python for Computational Problem Solving (UEyyCS151A)
* Engineering Mathematics - I (UEyyMA141A)

**SECOND SEMESTER**
* Problem Solving with C (UEyyCS151B)
* Engineering Mathematics - II (UEyyMA141B)

#### The Physics Cycle
* Engineering Physics (UEyyPH151x)
* Elements of Electrical Engineering (UEyyEE141x)
* Mechanical Engineering Sciences (UEyyME131x)
* Environmental Studies and Life Sciences (UEyyEV111x)

#### The Chemistry Cycle
* Engineering Chemistry (UEyyCY151x)
* Electronic Principles and Devices (UEyyEC141x)
* Engineering Statics - Mechanics (UEyyCV131x)
* Constitution Of India , Cyber Law and Professional Ethics (ULyyCE111x)
